# Would You Rather..? Project

## Description
WouldYouRather..?: In this project, a user will be able to play the “Would You Rather?” game. This game is about that a user is asked a question and he/she has two options to choose from.
It also allows the user to create his own NEW QUESTION and then the whole questions will be updated where the user's new question is located.
At last, the user is able to watch his score against the other users in the Leader Board tab.

The Project is to:
* Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy.
* Create the UI using React Bootstrap 
* Create Redux store which holds the data.
* Build The Static Version in React.
* Build The Dynamic Version in React.
* Connecting React with Redux store
